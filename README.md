# 🧠 Memory Agents – From Continuity to Cognition

This repository is a **progressive exploration of memory systems for AI agents**.

The goal is not to build a single “chatbot with memory”, but to **systematically design, implement, and understand memory as a cognitive system**—the same way humans use memory for continuity, planning, learning, and identity.

Each project builds on the previous one. Nothing is skipped. Nothing is hidden behind frameworks.

## Why Memory Agents?

Most AI systems today are stateless, reactive, short-lived, and context-fragile.

Real intelligence requires **memory**:
- memory of the past  
- memory of what matters  
- memory that shapes future decisions  

This repository treats memory as a **first-class design problem**, not a feature toggle.

## 📘 Project 1 – Short-Term Memory (Continuity)

**Goal:**  
Give the agent continuity across turns.

**What’s built:**
- Rolling window memory  
- Explicit forgetting  
- Deterministic context size  

**Key insight:**  
Memory is not what you store.  
Memory is **what you choose to forget**.
