# Project 1 – Short-Term Memory Agent

This project demonstrates a minimal short-term memory system for an AI agent.

## What it shows
- Explicit memory storage (no hidden magic)
- Deterministic forgetting via a rolling window
- Clear separation between memory writing and reading
- A simple agent loop without external frameworks

## What it does NOT try to do
- Long-term memory
- Vector databases
- Summarization
- Planning or reasoning

This project is a foundation for more advanced memory agents.
